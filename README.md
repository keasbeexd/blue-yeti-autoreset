# blue-yeti-autoreset

`blue-yeti-autoreset` is a Linux recovery utility for a Blue Yeti Classic that is
detected normally by USB, ALSA, and PipeWire but stops delivering capture
samples. Recording applications can open the microphone and ALSA can report a
running 44.1 or 48 kHz stream while its hardware pointer remains at zero. The
most visible symptom is no microphone capture after boot even though the Yeti
remained connected and appears ready to use. The same fault can be reproduced
by some logical USB hub power cycles. It cannot be repaired by restarting
PipeWire, rebinding `snd-usb-audio`, or issuing a host USB reset.

The traditional workaround is to physically unplug and reconnect the Yeti, or
otherwise remove USB power long enough to give it a complete power cycle. That
works because the microphone performs its full cold-start initialization when
power returns. This utility provides the equivalent recovery automatically,
without requiring access to the cable after every affected boot.

The utility automatically recovers the microphone by sending the same volatile
ROM-reset command used by the official control software. The command resets the
microphone's MCU and USB logic, causes a clean
disconnect/re-enumeration, and restores capture without flashing firmware or
writing persistent settings.

## Supported device

- USB vendor/product: `046d:0ab7`
- Firmware (`bcdDevice`): `0.20` (`0020` in sysfs)
- USB Audio Class: UAC1
- Known affected production era: 2020-2023

At boot, the service accepts any serial number for that exact device and
firmware. It reads each matching serial from sysfs, and the reset binary checks
the device identity and serial again before the request is sent.

This utility is intended for 2020-2023-era Blue Yeti Classic CR units using this
hardware and firmware. Blue reused the Yeti name across revisions, so the year
or enclosure alone is not a compatibility check; the USB ID and firmware value
above are authoritative.

## Install

This project is not packaged on the AUR or any other distribution repository.
Install it from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/keasbeexd/blue-yeti-autoreset.git
cd blue-yeti-autoreset
make check
sudo make install
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now blue-yeti-autoreset.service
sudo systemctl enable blue-yeti-autoreset-resume.service
```

`make install` respects `DESTDIR` for staged/packaged builds (e.g.
`make DESTDIR=/tmp/pkgroot install`). Build-time dependencies (make, libusb,
pkgconf, a C17 compiler, systemd, and POSIX `sh`) are listed again under
[Build and test](#build-and-test).

The installation provides two systemd services that must each be enabled once:

- `blue-yeti-autoreset.service` runs once during each boot after initial udev
  device processing has settled. USB reconnections later in the same boot do
  not trigger another automatic reset.
- `blue-yeti-autoreset-resume.service` runs once after the system resumes from
  suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, or suspend-then-hibernate, since the same
  fault reappears whenever the microphone stays powered across one of those
  transitions. It is a separate unit, ordered `After=` the corresponding sleep
  targets and pulled in by `WantedBy=` those same targets, so systemd starts it
  every time the machine wakes rather than only once per boot.

To enable automatic recovery starting with the next boot/resume without
resetting an already connected microphone immediately:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable blue-yeti-autoreset.service blue-yeti-autoreset-resume.service
```

## Uninstall

Disable and stop both services, then remove the installed files from this
checkout:

```sh
sudo systemctl disable --now blue-yeti-autoreset.service blue-yeti-autoreset-resume.service
sudo make uninstall
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

`make uninstall` removes `blue-yeti-reset`, the `blue-yeti-autoreset` wrapper,
both systemd unit files, and the installed README/LICENSE copies, using the
same `DESTDIR` (if any) that was passed to `make install`.

## How it works

1. `blue-yeti-autoreset.service` starts once during boot after initial udev
   processing has settled. `blue-yeti-autoreset-resume.service` starts once
   after every return from suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, or
   suspend-then-hibernate, because the microphone stays powered across those
   transitions the same way it does across a warm boot and can end up in the
   same stuck state.
2. Either unit's wrapper scans sysfs for every device with the supported VID,
   PID, firmware version, and a non-empty serial, then invokes
   `blue-yeti-reset` for each serial.
3. The binary verifies VID, PID, firmware version, and serial, temporarily
   detaches AudioControl interface 0, and claims it through libusb.
4. It sends one fixed extension-unit `SET_CUR` request:

```text
bmRequestType = 0x21
bRequest      = 0x01
wValue        = 0x0a00
wIndex        = 0x1900
wLength       = 8
payload       = 00 09 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

5. The firmware resets and the microphone re-enumerates. No hotplug rule
   starts either service again mid-boot or mid-session; `RemainAfterExit`
   keeps `blue-yeti-autoreset.service` active for the rest of the boot, and
   `blue-yeti-autoreset-resume.service` simply goes back to `inactive` until
   the next sleep/resume cycle pulls it in again.

## Manual recovery

Without arguments, the binary prints its exact transaction and does not access
USB:

```sh
blue-yeti-reset
```

An intentional live reset requires both the action flag and device serial:

```sh
sudo blue-yeti-reset --execute-reset --serial SERIAL
```

There is no option to select another opcode or supply an arbitrary payload.

Manual recovery is a fallback, not the recommended fix for suspend/hibernate:
enable `blue-yeti-autoreset-resume.service` (see Install) so the reset runs
automatically on every wake instead. If a manual reset is run while an
application still holds the microphone open for capture, the interface
detach/reattach can race with that application and leave the device
unresponsive until it is physically unplugged and reconnected; close any app
that has the Yeti open for recording before running `blue-yeti-reset` by
hand.

## Logs

Inspect the service state and this boot's recovery logs:

```sh
systemctl status blue-yeti-autoreset.service
journalctl -b -u blue-yeti-autoreset.service
```

Recovery logs from suspend/hibernate resumes are under the resume unit, still
within the current boot's journal:

```sh
systemctl status blue-yeti-autoreset-resume.service
journalctl -b -u blue-yeti-autoreset-resume.service
```

## Build and test

Development dependencies are make, libusb, pkgconf, a C17 compiler, systemd,
and POSIX `sh`.

```sh
make
make check
```

`make check` builds with strict warnings, verifies plan-only mode, checks shell
syntax and boot-time device discovery, and validates the systemd unit. It never
sends a live USB request.

## Limitations

- Recovery is proactive once at boot and once per suspend/hibernate resume
  (when `blue-yeti-autoreset-resume.service` is enabled); it does not react to
  later USB reconnections within an otherwise-awake session, continuously
  sample audio, or diagnose unrelated capture failures.
- A reset briefly removes and recreates the ALSA and PipeWire devices.
- Firmware versions other than `0.20` are intentionally rejected because their
  reset handlers have not been verified.
- Automatic recovery requires systemd.

## Cause of the bug

When the microphone remains powered across a host boot, firmware 0.20 can
complete its USB bus-reset handler and audio setup while a deeper capture domain
remains powered or insufficiently reset. The handler does call the normal audio
initialization routine, but it does not restore the hardware to the same state
as a cold start. USB endpoints return, the microphone accepts the streaming
interface, and ALSA reports a running stream, but the hardware pointer never
advances. Firmware opcode `0x09` resets the MCU and that deeper device state, as
a full USB power cycle does. The exact surviving ADC, PLL, clock, codec, or
stream-engine state has not yet been isolated.
